    The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] PL: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf,
    is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies
    of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog, though gray wolves,
    as popularly understood, only comprise wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest
    extant member of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished from other Canis
    species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a
    longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species,
    such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them.
    The wolf's fur is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies
    in the arctic region may be nearly all white.

    Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently
    recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.
    They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea.
    The order was formerly much more diverse during the Pleistocene, but most species became
    extinct during the Late Pleistocene epoch. Distinctive features of elephants include a
    long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but
    sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing and is prehensile, bringing food and
    water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor
    teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.
    The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as
    in communication. African elephants have larger
    ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs.

    Dorsally, rainbow snakes have smooth, glossy bluish-black back scales, with three red stripes.
    They have short tails, with a spiny tip which they sometimes use as a probe.
    Adults may show yellow coloration along the sides and on the head.
    They usually grow to a total length (including tail) of 36-48 inches (91–122 cm), although
    some specimens have been recorded up to 66 inches (168 cm) in total length.[4]
    Females are larger than males.
